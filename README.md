This purpose of this project was to develop algorithms that make betting decisions in a game of Limit Texas Hold'em Poker.
The necessary game engine was provided. My contribution was the decision making algorithms. This is implemented in the 
three source files:

1. MakeDecision_Default.m
2. StageUpdater_Default.m
3. UpdateOpponent_Default.m

The file poker_bot_writeup.pdf describes the general decision making stragegy. See poker_engine_readme.txt for a description
of how the poker engine works.

# Usage

A game of poker can be started by running poker_main. The BNT toolbox is necessary to compete against previous year's poker agents.
However, my own decision making algorithms do not require this toolbox.
